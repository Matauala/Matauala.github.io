				<h2>Our History</h2>		
				<h4>
					The Tokelau - New Zealand community has a long-standing history spanning over 50 years.
				</h4>
				<h5>
					This history began with the early migration of Tokelau people from the small atolls of Fakaofo, Nukunonu and Atafu in the1950s.
				</h5>
				<p>
					The New Zealand government instituted the Tokelau Resettlement Scheme (1966-1976) which	launched the journey of many young families and	young people to New Zealand.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Atafu Tokelau Community Group was founded by these first settlers who were in search	of better opportunities in education and employment for their families in the home islands and in New Zealand.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1978, land was purchased and a purpose-built	community hall named Matauala (another name	for Atafu), which was officially opened in 1987.
				</p>
				<p>
					The vision and inspiration of Matauala is a centre they can call their own. This became an investment for future generations to continue the Atafu ethos and culture as a model that ensures our family structures, values, culture and traditions are maintained.
				</p>
				<p>
					This centre represents Atafu’s home away from home.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Atafu Tokelau Community Group was registered as an incorporated society in March 1981 and become a charitable trust in 2009. 
				</p>						
				<p>
					This year marks 35 years since we have become a registered legal entity in New Zealand and remains true to its humble beginnings and objectives:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Providing an organisation where members combine and work together to promote the social, cultural, educational development, health and welfare of the people in the Tokelau community and other
						people interested in Tokelau activities; and
					</li>
					<li>
						To manage and effectively operate a community centre that serves the needs of its community.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The collective asset value for Atafu Tokelau Community Group is currently estimated at $4.5 million. This consists of the Matauala community facility and landspace, and a residential property which is leased to tenants for a period of 3 years which assists them into home ownership or the rental market.
				</p>
				<p>
					Matauala has and continues to be a focal point for the Tokelau community in	Wellington but has also served the needs of the wider community such as; delegations from overseas, government agency engagements, launch events, family reunions and gatherings and has also hosted local school students, teachers and families.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whilst our inception was birthed from humble beginings we are proud of our many sucesses to date. We remain committed to recasting Atafu Tokelau’s future direction as testament to this legacy and for future generations to come.

				<h2>Present</h2>					
				<p>
					A Statistical Snapshot of Tokelau people in New Zealand
				</p>					
				<p>

Wellington is home to the largest Tokelau population with almost 50% (3,525) of the overall population in New Zealand making this city their home. Only 1,400 Tokelauans live in the home islands. The Tokelauan population comprised of 7,176 people. Almost 74% of the
					population were born in New Zealand this comprises of 5,199 people; we are also	a youthful population with a median age of 19.2 years.
				</p>
				
				<p>Other key highlights:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Wellington region (49.1 percent or 3,525 people), followed by the Auckland region (27.3 percent or 1,959 people), and the Bay of Plenty	region (6.4 percent or 456 people).

					</li>

				<h2>Our Future</h2>					
				<h4> TE KANAVA STRATEGIC OVERVIEW</h4>
				<h5>
					The strategic plan has been gifted the name of Te Kanava which is a native tree	(Cordia Subcordata) that flourishes in the forest of Tagaleleva, Atafu.
				</h5>
				<p>
					The roots are well grounded anchoring this tree as a solid foundation. The	durability of the timber can withstand elements and therefore the most preferred wood for making traditional canoes and other crafts.
				</p>
				<p>
					The branches of the kanava tree are a safe haven for birds to nest, during stormy weather and a resting place during the migration season.
				</p>
				<p>
					This symbolises the importance of our community to be a shelter of compassion and care for our people, especially those most vulnerable in our community.
				</p>
				<p>
					Te Kanava is known to grow in challenging environmental conditions and therefore becomes an inspiration to our organisation to be resilient, to be adaptive in our pursuit for opportunities that advance our community in a rapidly changing society and world.
				</p>
				<p>
					Toku kāiga, he kānava, he fau e hē uia.	My community, my heritage, a gift that is forever treasured.
				</p>					
				<h3>Vision </h3>
				<h5>
					“Our Atafu-Tokelau community aims to be an anchor for our families to be strong, resilient,	well-connected and thriving”

				<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
